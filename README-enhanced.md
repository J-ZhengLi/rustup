# Rustup: the Rust toolchain installer (enhanced)

**Don't Look at this, it's not finished**

## Checklist

- [ ] Replace configuration through env vars such as `RUSTUP/CARGO_HOME`, `RUSTUP_UPDATE_SERVER`, `RUSTUP_UPDATE_ROOT`
to a more user friendly way.
- [ ] Add localization support
- [ ] Add Terminal UI for a more interactive custom installation process
